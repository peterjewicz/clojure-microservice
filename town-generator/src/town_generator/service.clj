;; Including Content-Length
;; -----------------------------
;;
;; Most response-oriented utilities in Pedestal support streaming operations.
;; It's often the case that these utilities are narrowly focused -- they focus
;; only on the streamed response and nothing else (they overstep control or signaling).
;;
;; However, sometimes you'll end up designing an API where all the response
;; bodies are finite, and you'll want to set headers important to your
;; application and/or consumers.
;; In that case, defining your own coercion interceptors are best.
;;
;; Here we define an interceptor to coerce `:body` into a JSON string,
;; and set both the Content-Type and Content-Length.
;;
;; NOTE: You can also tell your container to always set Content-Length,
;;       which is often a better option.
